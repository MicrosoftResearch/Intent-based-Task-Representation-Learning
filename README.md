# Intent based Task Representation Learning

This repository contains the code and sample data for running the method proposed in the following paper: Naoki Otani, Michael Gamon, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Mei Yang, Sri Raghu Malireddi, and Oriana Riva. 2022. LITE: Intent-based Task Representation Learning Using Weak Supervision. In Proc. of NAACL-HLT.

Directories:

- `DataPreprocessing/`: code and sample data for data preprocessing
- `TaskReprLearning/`: code and data for training an encoder
- `Evaluation/`: code for running downstream experiments

See `README.md` in each directory for more details.
